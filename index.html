    <!--Poem-->
    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
        who said -'Two vast nd trunkless legs of stone<br>
        stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand,<br>
        Half sunk a shettereed visage lies, whose frown,<br>
        And wrinkeled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
        Tell thats its sculptor well those passions read<br>
        which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless thinbgs,<br>
        The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:<br>
        My name is Ozymandies, King of Kings;<br>
        Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
        Nothing besides remains. Round the decay<br>
        of that colossal Wreck, boundless nad bare<br>
        The lone and level sends stretcyh far away.<br>'
